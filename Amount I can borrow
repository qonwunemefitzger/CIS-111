Sure! I've modified the program to include the calculation of how much money you can afford to borrow given the monthly payment, interest rate, and number of months:

```python
def calculate_monthly_repayment(PV, r, n):
    # Convert APR to monthly interest rate
    r = r / (100 * 12)

    # Calculate the monthly repayment amount using the formula
    Pmt = r * PV / (1 - (1 + r)**(-n))

    return Pmt

def calculate_affordable_loan_amount(Pmt, r, n):
    # Convert APR to monthly interest rate
    r = r / (100 * 12)

    # Calculate the maximum affordable loan amount using the formula
    PV = (1 - (1 + r)**(-n)) * Pmt / r

    return PV

def main():
    Pmt = 1000
    r = 7.45
    n = 48

    # Calculate the monthly repayment amount
    monthly_repayment = calculate_monthly_repayment(Pmt, r, n)

    print(f"Monthly Repayment Amount: ${monthly_repayment:.2f}")

    # Calculate the maximum affordable loan amount
    max_loan_amount = calculate_affordable_loan_amount(Pmt, r, n)

    print(f"Maximum Affordable Loan Amount: ${max_loan_amount:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now, the program calculates both the monthly repayment amount and the maximum affordable loan amount given the provided monthly payment (`Pmt`), interest rate (`r`), and number of months (`n`). When you run the program, it will display both values based on the given input.
